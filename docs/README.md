# MedBot Documentation

Welcome to the MedBot documentation! This directory contains comprehensive guides for setting up, using, and understanding the MedBot medical transcription system. This Bot helps you record the conversation bw a doctor and a patient. Then uses wisper and pyannote to transcribe and diarize the conversation. It is then fed into a model that tells which one is the doctor and which one the patient and generates a short note summary for that conversation including symptoms and prescriptions to keep a medical history.
